This project presents a potential solution for simplifying parking management through the use of a "Parking Space Counter" system. This system leverages basic image processing techniques to automate the counting of parked cars and available spaces in a parking lot.

Here's a breakdown of how it functions:

- A camera captures an image of the parking lot.
- Image processing techniques analyze the captured image, differentiating between parked cars and empty spaces.
- By identifying the number of objects classified as cars, the system determines the total number of vehicles currently parked.
- The system calculates the number of empty spaces by comparing the total number of parking spaces to the identified parked cars.

The simplicity of this system is its key strength. By relying on fundamental image processing techniques, the solution becomes cost-effective and accessible compared to more complex technologies. This approach offers a practical way to automate parking space management, potentially reducing frustration and wasted time for drivers searching for a spot.

While focusing on a basic implementation, this project lays the groundwork for further exploration. Integrating more advanced image processing techniques or additional sensors could enhance the system's capabilities in the future.
